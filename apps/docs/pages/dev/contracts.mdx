# Deployed Contracts

import { HubContracts, SpokeContracts, NetworkOverview } from '../../components/ContractAddresses';

All contract addresses are pulled live from `@swr/chains`. They update automatically when the package is updated after a new deployment.

## Supported Networks

<NetworkOverview />

## Hub Contracts

The hub chain is the canonical source of truth. All registries (wallet, transaction, contract) live here, along with the FraudRegistryHub entry point, operator infrastructure, and the cross-chain inbox.

## Spoke Contracts

Spoke chains accept registrations locally and relay them to the hub via cross-chain bridge adapters. Each spoke deploys a SpokeRegistry, a FeeManager, and a bridge adapter. See [Hub-Spoke Architecture](/concepts/hub-spoke) for details on how cross-chain messaging works.
