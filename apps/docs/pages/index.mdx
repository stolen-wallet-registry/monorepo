# Stolen Wallet Registry

A cross-chain fraud detection and transparency registry for Web3.

## What is the Stolen Wallet Registry?

The Stolen Wallet Registry (SWR) provides victims of crypto fraud a decentralized mechanism to register stolen wallets and transactions, enabling off-ramps, wallets, and other Web3 services to access verified fraud data for prevention and recovery.

### Core Value Proposition

- **Victim empowerment** - Register compromised wallets even without access to funds
- **Shared intelligence** - Exchanges and off-ramps gain access to crowdsourced fraud data
- **On-chain transparency** - Reduces siloed fraud data across the ecosystem
- **Cross-chain support** - CAIP-10 compliant for multi-chain address tracking

## Three Subregistries

| Registry                | Purpose                                        | Who Can Submit          |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Stolen Wallet**       | Mark entire wallets as permanently compromised | Individuals + Operators |
| **Fraudulent Contract** | Catalog malicious smart contract addresses     | Operators only          |
| **Stolen Transaction**  | Flag specific fraudulent transactions          | Individuals + Operators |

## Registration Methods

Choose the method that fits your situation:

### 1. Standard Registration

Sign and pay with the same wallet you're registering. Best when you still have temporary access to a compromised wallet.

[Standard Registration Guide](/guide/registration-standard)

### 2. Self-Relay Registration

Sign with your compromised wallet, then switch to a different wallet to pay for gas. Useful when your wallet is drained but you have another wallet with funds.

[Self-Relay Guide](/guide/registration-self-relay)

### 3. P2P Relay Registration

Sign with your compromised wallet and send the signature to a trusted helper via libp2p. The helper pays gas on your behalf. For when you have no funds at all.

## Quick Start

Ready to register a stolen wallet?

1. **Connect your wallet** at the [registration app](https://app.stolenwallet.registry)
2. **Choose your registration method** based on your situation
3. **Complete the two-phase process** (acknowledgement + registration)
4. **Done** - Your wallet is now marked as stolen on-chain

## Security Model

The registry uses a **two-phase EIP-712 signature flow** to prevent phishing attacks:

1. **Acknowledgement Phase** - Sign intent to register, starts a grace period
2. **Grace Period** - 1-4 minute randomized delay
3. **Registration Phase** - Sign final registration within the time window

This requires two separate signatures, making it much harder for attackers to trick victims into accidentally registering legitimate wallets.

## For Operators

Operators are DAO-approved entities (exchanges, security firms) with enhanced capabilities:

- Batch submission of addresses across all registries
- Higher trust signals for submitted data
- Integration with Operator-as-Paymaster for gasless user registration

## Tech Stack

Built with the modern Web3 stack:

- **Contracts**: Foundry, Solidity 0.8.21+, OpenZeppelin
- **Frontend**: Vite, React 19, wagmi 2.x, viem 2.x
- **P2P**: libp2p 3.x with WebRTC
- **Settlement**: Base (Optimism L2)
