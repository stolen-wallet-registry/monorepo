# Stolen Wallet Registry

The Stolen Wallet Registry (SWR) is a cross-chain, on-chain fraud registry. Victims of crypto theft register compromised wallets, flagged transactions, and malicious contracts -- creating a shared fraud intelligence layer that exchanges, wallets, and dApps can query.

## Why It Matters

- **Victim empowerment** -- Register a stolen wallet even if you have no funds left (relay methods cover gas)
- **Shared intelligence** -- Fraud data is public and on-chain, not siloed inside individual exchanges
- **Cross-chain** -- Registrations on any supported L2 settle to the hub chain via Hyperlane

## Three Registries

| Registry        | What gets registered                    | Who can submit          | Security model                    |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Wallet**      | Compromised wallet addresses            | Individuals + Operators | Two-phase EIP-712 signatures      |
| **Transaction** | Fraudulent transaction hashes (batched) | Individuals + Operators | Two-phase EIP-712 + merkle proofs |
| **Contract**    | Malicious contract addresses            | Operators only          | Single-phase batch submission     |

## Three Registration Methods

| Method         | How it works                                               | Best for                             |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Standard**   | Sign and pay with the wallet you are registering           | You still have temporary access      |
| **Self-Relay** | Sign with compromised wallet, pay with a different wallet  | Wallet drained, but you have another |
| **P2P Relay**  | Sign with compromised wallet, a helper pays gas via libp2p | No funds at all                      |

## Security Model

Every wallet and transaction registration requires **two separate signatures** with a randomized delay between them. This two-phase EIP-712 flow prevents single-transaction phishing attacks -- an attacker cannot trick a victim into registering a legitimate wallet in one step.
