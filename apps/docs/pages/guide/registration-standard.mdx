# Standard Registration

Register a stolen wallet using the same wallet to sign and pay.

## When to Use

Use Standard Registration when:

- You still have access to the compromised wallet
- The wallet has enough ETH for gas fees
- You want the simplest registration flow

## Prerequisites

- Web3 wallet connected
- Compromised wallet address
- ~$5 in ETH for gas + registration fee

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Connect Your Wallet

1. Navigate to the [registration app](https://app.stolenwallet.registry)
2. Click "Connect Wallet"
3. Select your wallet provider
4. Connect the wallet you want to register as stolen

### Step 2: Enter Details

1. Confirm the wallet address displayed matches your compromised wallet
2. Review the registration fee (~$5 in ETH)
3. Optionally check additional options (support NFT, etc.)

### Step 3: Sign Acknowledgement

1. Click "Sign Acknowledgement"
2. Your wallet will prompt you to sign an EIP-712 message
3. Review the message contents:
   - `owner`: Your wallet address
   - `forwarder`: Your wallet address (same in standard mode)
   - `nonce`: Current nonce
   - `deadline`: When this signature expires
4. Sign the message

### Step 4: Submit Acknowledgement Transaction

1. Click "Submit Acknowledgement"
2. Confirm the transaction in your wallet
3. Wait for the transaction to be mined
4. The grace period begins

### Step 5: Wait for Grace Period

1. A 1-4 minute countdown will appear
2. This randomized delay is a security feature
3. You can close the browser - progress is saved locally
4. Return before the registration window expires

### Step 6: Sign Registration

1. Once the grace period ends, click "Sign Registration"
2. Sign the second EIP-712 message
3. Review to confirm it's for registration (not acknowledgement)

### Step 7: Submit Registration Transaction

1. Click "Submit Registration"
2. Confirm the transaction in your wallet
3. Wait for the transaction to be mined
4. **Done!** Your wallet is now registered as stolen

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid Signer" Error

The wallet connected doesn't match the wallet being registered. Make sure you're connected with the correct wallet.

### "Nonce Already Used" Error

You've already completed a registration phase. Refresh the page and check if you're already in a later step.

### "Window Expired" Error

The registration window has passed. You'll need to start over with a new acknowledgement.

### Transaction Stuck

If your transaction is pending for a long time, you may need to increase gas or cancel and resubmit.
