# Quick Start Guide

Get started with the Stolen Wallet Registry in minutes.

## Prerequisites

- A Web3 wallet (MetaMask, Rainbow, Coinbase Wallet, etc.)
- The wallet address you want to register as stolen
- ETH for gas fees (or a helper for P2P relay)

## Choose Your Registration Method

| Method                                       | When to Use                                               | You Need                  |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| [Standard](/guide/registration-standard)     | You have access to the compromised wallet and funds       | One wallet                |
| [Self-Relay](/guide/registration-self-relay) | Compromised wallet is drained but you have another wallet | Two wallets               |
| [P2P Relay](/guide/registration-p2p-relay)   | No funds at all, need a trusted helper                    | Trusted friend with funds |

## The Two-Phase Process

All registration methods follow the same security pattern:

### Phase 1: Acknowledgement

1. Connect your wallet
2. Enter the address being registered
3. Sign the EIP-712 acknowledgement message
4. Submit the transaction (or have your relayer submit it)

### Phase 2: Registration

After a 1-4 minute grace period:

1. Sign the EIP-712 registration message
2. Submit the final transaction
3. Your wallet is now registered as stolen

## Why Two Phases?

The two-phase process prevents phishing attacks. If someone tricks you into signing an acknowledgement, you'd need to sign a **second** message to complete registration. This gives you time to realize something is wrong.

## After Registration

Once registered:

- The wallet is permanently marked as stolen on-chain
- Events are emitted for off-chain indexers
- Exchanges and off-ramps listening to the registry can flag associated transactions
- The registration cannot be undone (by design)

## Verification

You can verify a registration:

1. Check the transaction on Etherscan/Basescan
2. Query the registry contract directly
3. Use the verification page on the app
