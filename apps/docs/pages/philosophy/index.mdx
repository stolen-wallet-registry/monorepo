The guiding principles behind the Stolen Wallet Registry.

## The Problem

Crypto fraud is rampant, and the data about it is siloed:

- **Exchanges** maintain internal fraud databases they don't share
- **Victims** have no standardized way to report stolen wallets
- **Security firms** publish reports but data isn't machine-readable
- **Wallets** can't warn users about known malicious contracts

The result? Stolen funds flow freely between chains and off-ramps because there's no coordinated, on-chain source of truth.

## The Solution

A **decentralized, cross-chain registry** that:

1. **Gives victims agency** - Register your own wallet as stolen, even without funds
2. **Breaks down silos** - Shared data benefits the entire ecosystem
3. **Provides transparency** - On-chain, verifiable, permanent records
4. **Enables coordination** - Exchanges, wallets, and dApps can all read from one source

## Core Principles

### Victim-First Design

The registry exists to help victims. Every design decision prioritizes:

- **Accessibility** - Register without funds via relay mechanisms
- **Security** - Two-phase process prevents phishing
- **Permanence** - Once registered, a wallet stays registered

### Decentralization

- **On-chain storage** - No central database to censor
- **DAO governance** - Operator approval and dispute resolution
- **Open data** - Anyone can read, query, and integrate

### Minimal Trust

- **Self-attestation** - You prove you own what you're registering
- **Cryptographic signatures** - EIP-712 typed data
- **Public verification** - All registrations are on-chain

### Pragmatic Progress

- **Start with wallets** - Highest trust signal (owner signature)
- **Add contracts** - Operator submissions with review
- **Defer transactions** - Complex trust model, solve later

## What This Is Not

### Not a Blacklist Service

The registry provides **data**, not **enforcement**. It's up to integrators to decide how to use it:

- An exchange might flag transactions from registered wallets
- A wallet might warn users before interacting with registered contracts
- A dApp might refuse connections from registered addresses

The registry doesn't make these decisions. It provides information.

### Not a Recovery Service

Registering a wallet doesn't recover stolen funds. It:

- Creates a public record of the theft
- Helps prevent further damage (the thief can't easily off-ramp)
- Contributes to ecosystem-wide fraud intelligence

### Not a Guarantee

Registration doesn't guarantee:

- Funds will be recovered
- The thief will be caught
- All exchanges will honor the registration

It's one tool in the broader fight against crypto fraud.

## The Vision

A world where:

1. **Victims have a voice** - Immediate, free, permanent way to report theft
2. **Fraud data flows freely** - Breaking down corporate silos
3. **Attackers face friction** - Off-ramping stolen funds becomes harder
4. **The ecosystem learns** - Patterns emerge from aggregated data
